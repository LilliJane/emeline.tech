											<h2>Who I am</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a 26-year-old Software Engineer. I graduated from Epitech with a master's degree, and I studied sustainable and service design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, where I also co-redacted an essay about Natural Language Processing. <br /> 
											I have two main interests: distributed systems and machine learning (from a software engineer perspective). My experiences are all about back-end engineering using Kubernetes, public cloud (AWS, GCP), Go and Python. <br />
											I worked at Nerdalize as a Software Engineer, and I was the co-founder of a French neobank. I previously worked at Epitech as an IT program manager. I'm now looking for a new job to continue working on my technical skills.</p>

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>To get my master in Computer Science and Information Technology, I studied for five years at Epitech, including one year abroad, at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, in the Netherlands.</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/epitech-logo-noir-baseline-anglais.png" alt="epitech. The future of software, the best of innovation" /></span>I started my studies at Epitech in 2013. This school has a specific trainging method based on an innovative model which emphasizes three qualities which are increasingly sought after: adaptability, self-progression and a sense of project. <br />
								Through my five years at Epitech, I got to learn to use the C and C++ language, but I also got to work as an intern for 24 months. I had the opportunity to start working as a teaching assistant at the end of my first year of studies. This was one of the best experience I had: I got to teach and to explain my knowledge to help other students. More than technical skills, I got to improve my communication and organisation skills which are essential for professionals. <br />
								My main project at Epitech was a two-year long project named alayoo. This project was based on collaborative tourism and its purpose was to connect people to share knowledge about places. I got to create the full back-end, meaning I developed an API in Go, using PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch to store and index the data. I also created a complete documentation based on Slate so the other 5 developers could use the API as easily as possible. On a soft skill side, this project has been done completely remotely, across multiple time zones.
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/thuas-logo-grey.png" alt="the hague university of applied sciences" /></span>In 2016-2017, I spent one year at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This university uses the same pedagogical scheme as Epitech, which is a project-based training method. This year abroad was the perfect opportunity to discover a new culture but also to learn more about unfamiliar subjects: I learned a lot about Service Design and Sustainable Design, and I co-wrote a paper about Natural Language Processing. You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzUbYzkbYRaaMU8talg4R0YycUU/view">here</a> (it sure is outdated as it's a constantly evolving field but it might interest you).<br />
								I also got time to make research and to write my first essay regarding Women in Technology / Gender diversity. It's available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzUbYzkbYRaaWGNJQm1rMm9WLWM/view">here</a>. I would love to discuss about it with you, so feel free to reach me! <br />
								Finally, I collaborated with a few other people, all of different nationalities, to create a mobile application focused on arts. I worked on the server side, put the website online and created the API in Python.
